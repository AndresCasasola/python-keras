# Keras examples
## bigger_than25.py example
This program creates four arrays:
- x_train and x_test: **integer** input values between 0 and 50 for the neural network.
- y_train and y_test: **binary** output solution.

The condition to learn for the neural network is: 
- For inputs **bigger than 25 or equal** the solution is **1**.
- For inputs **smaller than 25** the solution is **0**.

Then the neural network train and predict.
